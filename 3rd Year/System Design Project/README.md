8 person team working for an entire semester on a football playing robot. The vision system was my primary focus, and so I have included the version that was scrapped due to segfaulting errors (errors that arose spontaneously, and existing in previous commits that had not previously shown errors). This code, as well as the individual reports for each milestone, are contained within the respective folders.

The entire codebase, used throughout the development process, can be seen at https://github.com/SDP1212.
