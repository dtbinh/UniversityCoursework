Second coursework involved implementing some of the suggestions made in the first project. I have included the entries submitted for marking, including the video demonstrating new features (as they were real time events, unable to be effectively demonstrated with a description). 

Report also details the precise changes made, so the contributions can be found in greater detail there.
