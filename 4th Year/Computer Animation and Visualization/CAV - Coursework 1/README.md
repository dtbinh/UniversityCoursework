Readme.txt contains a report detailing the major implementations of this animation. Allows the user to position/rotate the sample armadillo (included as a number of pngs, mostly of failures during the creation process). Uses inverse kinematics and forward kinematics to achieve different types of motion, with linear blending between motions. Written in C++.
