c-Net income  Preferred dividends exceeded net income in the year-ago period.
The company also said its financial results for 1986 also include $124 million in accumulated foreign exchange losses, which normally would be amortized over the remaining period of the loans to which they apply, but because of the uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan, were charged to current expenses.
The company said it reported a fourth quarter writedown in the value of its oil and gas properties of $1,204,000,000 before a reduction in deferred income taxes of $305 millioon, the result of a year-end accounting change in conjunction with the new full cost accounting guideline issued by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. This writedown is in addition to the $880 million writedown in the value of certain other assets taken largely in the third quarter.

The company said its net for the latest quarter benefited from the reversal of $15.6 million of unrealized loss before income taxes in its investment portfolio at the end of fiscal 1987.

The company noted that the television broadcasting business is seasonal with the first quarter generally contributing the lowest level of revenue.
The company said increased revenue and reduction in interest expense resulting from the recapitalization of the company in August 1987 was partially offset by the increased costs associated with the expansion of the company's network operations.
The company bought station KTMD serving Houston-Galveston in April 1988 and added several affiliates to its network line-up.

Regarding that restructuring, National Business said it has arranged a new $40 million (US) credit facility to replace its previous facility.

b-Included the previously-announced decision to sell the company's kitchen cabinet business and resulted in a 1988 after-tax loss on disposal of $45 million. The estimated loss on disposal, together with the cabinet business operating loss, have been separately classified as loss from discontinued operations. The after-tax losses from discontinued operations for 1988 and 1987 were $67.2 million and $5.5 million, respectively. The 1987 year also included the cumulative effect of a change in the method of accounting for income taxes which increased net earnings by $10.8 million, or 15 cents a share.
c-Net income  The company said operating results for the latest quarter and year included a charge of 14 cents a share and 20 cents a share, respectively, on an after-tax basis for a portion of the warranty charge related to product sold by Heil-Quaker.
The company also said that earnings for 1988 were also adversely affected by higher material costs not recovered through increased pricing, higher levels of interest expense and weaker results from the company's Brazilian affiliates. The effect of these adverse factors was partially offset by a reduction in the federal income tax rate.

b-Net loss  The latest second quarter loss included an $11,134,000 non-cash charge related to certain amendments under the company's Executive Retirement Plan.
The second quarter loss also reflected an increase in the company's net interest costs related to financing for the development and construction of the Mirage, the company's new resort-casino project on the Las Vegas strip, and the April 1989 financing related to Golden Nugget-downtown.
The year-ago second quarter loss is after a pretax expense of $5.6 million from a judgment against the company in a lawsuit, and unspecified financing costs associated with the Mirage.
The company attributed the latest 6-month net income to unspecified gains on the sale of certain equity investments in the first quarter.

The company said the latest quarter loss included a $17 million charge for income tax benefits established in the first quarter which are no longer available as a result of Ambase's most recent forecast which anticipates a pretax loss for all of 1990.
The latest year results reflect losses related to a decision to reduce the level of noninvestment grade bonds in its Home Insurance Co. unit's portfolio and ''condition deterioration in the financial condition of certain issuers of high-yield securities.''
