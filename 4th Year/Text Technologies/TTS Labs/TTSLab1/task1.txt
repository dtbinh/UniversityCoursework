the extent of apple computers troubles became more fully evident today the company announced a much bigger quarterly loss than had been expected and a big restructuring even as it began laying off employees at its headquarters in cupertino calif meanwhile kaleida the software joint venture with ibm through which apple has been developing software for multimedia consumer electronics products said that a nathaniel goldhaber was resigning as president and chief executive the resignation led a number of executives and silicon valley analysts to suggest that a distressed apple computer may be changing its strategy and reevaluating its commitment to both kaleida and taligent a second software joint venture with the international business machines corporation corporate pain this shows how much corporate pain ibm and apple are in said denise caruso editor of digital media a computer industry newsletter to cover the reorganization and the planned layoff of employees apple said it was taking a million charge resulting in a million loss for its third quarter it is the first quarterly loss for the company since the loss came despite a percent revenue increase to billion compared with billion for comparable period last year were confident we can put our business back on a growth path by aggressively pursuing market share while offering innovative technology michael h spindler apples president and chief executive said in a prepared statement at the same time we must significantly and permanently lower our cost of doing business mr spindler was recently made chief executive in place of john sculley who remains apples chairman apple described its reorganization as the first steps in a broad reengineering of the company today the company said it was consolidating itself into four business units each responsible for its own profits or losses the personal computer division the applesoft division the apple business systems division and the personal interactive electronics division the claris software business will remain a separate subsidiary the shift increases the influence of ian diery the former head of the companys worldwide sales and marketing business under the new arrangement mr diery will head the newly formed personal computer division which will have responsibility for marketing sales distribution manufacturing engineering and product development for the entire company new emphasis on software the reorganization also indicates that apple is planning to sharpen its focus on the software side of its business as part of the revamping david nagel who has previously headed the companys software division and its advanced technology group will head the new applesoft organization that is absorbing advanced technology there has been wide speculation that mr spindler would narrow apples focus but if that is happening it is not apparent in todays restructuring in addition to kaleida and taligent apple has a venture with ibm and motorola inc called power pc an austin tex business that has developed a new microprocessor chip that is expected to begin showing up in new personal computers early next year analysts see power pc as more likely to produce nearterm results for apple than the kaleida and taligent software efforts kaleida and taligent are attempting to create new standards in business and consumer software and are facing difficulty because of the struggle to create alternatives to the microsoft corporations growing influence in markets that range from desktop to corporate computing and in the market for new interactive media apple has some shortterm business problems to work out said paul saffo a computer industry consultant at the institute for the future a research and consulting firm in menlo park calif is michael spindler going to downshift and put off some of the longerterm stuff mr goldhaber a venture capitalist who joined kaleida shortly after it was formed in will continue to work with kaleida sharing the chairmanship with an ibm multimedia executive robert carberry but mr goldhaber will be replaced as president and chief executive by mike braun an ibm official who has played a key role in the armonk ny computer makers multimedia plans mr goldhaber said he was giving up daytoday oversight in part because of the kaleida boards decision against making the partnership a public company but he said that he planned to work with other startup ventures to build new businesses that would license the kaleida technology an insider at apple who insisted that he not be identified said mr goldhaber had come out on the short end in a conflict between kaleida and the apple personal interactive electronics division run by gaston bastiaens an executive who came to apple recently from philips electronics nv mr bastiaenss division and kaleida have been competing for the same market for interactive consumer electronics products kaleida is working on an advanced programming language and a software operating system for a new consumer appliance that would play interactive audio and video programming the software is technically impressive but it appears that apple and ibm have had difficulty in gaining broad support for the technology while many consumer electronics players wait for microsoft to make its moves many analysts believe that the most important market for the new technology will instead be in interactive television although kaleida has announced a partnership with motorola and scientificatlanta to build a digital settop terminal for interactive television much of the industry is focused on discussions to create a new software organization dubbed cablesoft those talks involve microsoft the cable system operators telecommunications inc and time warner inc as well as telephone companies including u s west bell atlantic and at t company reports

and the publisher harpercollins to the fox television network and the century fox film studio but current and former employees said the venture had been dogged by constant delays and frequent shifts in strategy in a bitter twist the venture plans to open its web site on the internet on tuesday so that browsers on the internet can get their first peek at news corporations efforts just as the company undergoes a wrenching restructuring the sad thing about news corp is that theyve always had the most visionary approach mr wester said but theyve had extraordinary difficulty in executing on that approach at the loftlike offices of news corp internet in chelsea yesterday employees were updating their resumes and trading the latest rumors about how deeply the layoffs were going to cut at the very moment that our work is going up on the web and were supposed to be celebrating we all assume were going to be fired said one young editor who asked not to be identified executives close to the venture said mcis departure made the job cuts unavoidable although mci will retain an equity stake in the venture of about percent it is channeling its cash into the new microsoft service which is called the microsoft network a spokesman for mci declined to comment yesterday but one executive close to the company said that mci had been impatient with the sluggish pace of developments at news corp internet weve got a better brand name with microsoft anyway the executive said mci the longdistance carrier based in washington has a broader alliance with news corporation and has agreed to invest up to billion in mr murdochs company several executives said the internet had become a peripheral part of that relationship mci and news corporation are teaming up to build a satellite broadcasting service using an orbital slot that mci recently acquired for million in an auction held by the federal communications commission news corporation is fundamentally a broadcasting company and film company and the corporations strategy is very focused on how to grow those assets said mark benerofe a former executive vice president of news corp internet who now owns his own consulting firm separately news corporation reported that net income dropped percent in its second quarter which ended dec to million on weak results at century fox and harpercollins the companys results were announced after the market closed in new york earlier the american depository receipts of news corporation rose cents to 21125 on the new york stock exchange each adr represents four shares of the company a spokesman said mr murdoch was unavailable for comment mr clark said that despite the online retrenchment mr murdoch had not given up hope of becoming a player on the internet rupert is still absolutely committed to this being a crucial distribution channel he said but we want to invest in where the internet industry is going not where the online industry has been one area of focus for the venture will now be the cable news channel that mr murdoch recently announced mr clark said news corporation would provide online text and video to supplement the material on its new service mr murdoch recently hired roger ailes the former chief executive of the cnbc cable channel to start the news service as a result executives close to news corporation said the editorial staff of the venture would not be hit as hard by job reductions as the customer service and marketing departments in particular they said news corporations sophisticated customer service center in lowell mass will be almost completely dismantled one senior editor at the online service jonathan miller resigned yesterday but people close to news corporation said anthea disney the editor in chief of the venture and the former editor of tv guide was probably secure the plan by mr murdoch to use the service as an adjunct to his cable news service would seem to put mci into an awkward position the companys new online partner microsoft has an alliance with nbc to develop a news service called msnbc but mci remains an equity investor in news corp internet which will be developing a competing online news service no telecommunications or media company wants to be left out of this game said mr benerofe the former news corp internet executive as a result there will be many more annulments divorces and separations than lifelong marriages company reports
