My Code - Contained within TTS.py
Necessary to run Beautiful Soup - bs4 folder

To Run:

start python
import TTS
use the function TTS.crawl(mode, soupmode) to run the function
mode = 1, 2 or 3 	(1 means you use the priority specified in the assignment,
			 2 means you use the inverse priority (lowest goes)
			 3 means you use the time at which the link was added)
soupmode = True or False (True if you want to use Beautiful Soup, False if you want to use my parser)
